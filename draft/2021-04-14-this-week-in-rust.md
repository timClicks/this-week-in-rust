## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty major week for [memory usage improvements] with an average of ~20% gains on memory usage for
release builds, and 5% on check builds, due to an update in the default allocator
used (to a more recent jemalloc). Wall time performance remained largely unchanged over this week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [4896450e..d32238](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4896450e7e0a522486b4d3a8d360ac4e1d2072a0&end=d32238532138485c80db4f2cd596372bce214e00&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
